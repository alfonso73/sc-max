some supercollider ugens ported to max-msp.

all credits are due to the original authors (James McCartney et alt.). these are merely ports to max/msp and might be helpful.
most text is taken directly from the original supercollider helpfiles.
if you haven't done so. check out supercollider as well. it is a really nice language for sound.

forks and patches are welcome. if someone wants to do a windows port please let me know. 
the included sc header files are from the supercollider sourceforge svn repository

bugs, anything else? contact me via github.
