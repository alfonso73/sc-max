ports by stephen lumenta

some supercollider ugens ported to max-msp 5. the focus lies on the noisier ones. 

all credits are due to the original authors (James McCartney et alt.). these are merely ports to max/msp and might be helpful.
most helptext is taken directly from the original supercollider helpfiles.
if you haven't done so. check out supercollider as well. it is a really nice language for sound.

bugs, anything else? contact me via github. http://github.com/sbl
